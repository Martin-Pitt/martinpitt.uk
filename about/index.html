		<h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I'm always looking for the hint of good in people.
			We can create a better world by understanding ourselves and others.
			I believe that a natural path to empathy would be through education and communication.
			
			Technology has enabled us to be more human than ever, even if we still have a long way to go.
			
			In my work, knowing what I am doing is meaningful is important to me; That my efforts have an impact on someone's quality of life.
		</p>
		<p>
			I prefer communicating in writing or alternatively in person.
			Phones are detached & uncomposed; With my personality & dyslexia (auditory), they can be a huge struggle.

		<h2 class="title">Work</h2>
		<p>
			Currently my occupation is as a <b>Fullstack Developer</b> at <b>The Hive Group</b>, which has two companies.
			The Hive Group has a philosophy to improve outcomes for patients by creating change in healthcare communications.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a <b>Fullstack Developer</b> my role involves hands-on development, prototyping, research, testing and supporting the rest of the tech team and also consultation with the rest of the group.
			Skills are ever changing with the fast-pace of web development.
			Aside from mastering HTML, CSS & JavaScript, I've been very proactive in picking up Cordova, Node.js, Electron and Arduino as new platforms as they were introduced to the public.
			I feel that these platforms have considerably expanded what is possible using web technology and radically rewritten the meaning of what it means to be a web developer today.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Hive</b> is a creative healthcare agency of <b>The Hive Group</b> that has always put patients at the heart of strategies.
			Making a real difference to people, by looking at opportunities for patients and healthcare professionals.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Pollen</b> is a medical communications consultancy of <b>The Hive Group</b>, using storytelling to help bring understanding.
			Developing narratives that help people to experience information, rather than absorb it passively.
