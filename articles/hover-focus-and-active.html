Cursor, hover, focus andâ€¦ active! ðŸŽ¬

It's amazing how often I see websites that miss out on these simple interactions.
They are low hanging fruit, but make really increase productivity and understanding of a website/app.

They provide simple mechanisms for a person to understand an UI, and make it more accessible at the same time.

I still remember the frustrations I once had with a website when something really normal happen in the day of a programmer:
Your hands/fingers/wrist hurt from typing too much / straining yourself.

When every interaction becomes important and you really need to know you didn't waste time, having an UI
that responds with feedback is really crucial. Misclicks, overshoot/undershoot, etc  because you weren't
sure where a hitbox started or ended or if an interaction was possible at all.

It seems the rise of touchscreens has created a decline in these simple interactions.
But even touchscreens benefit especially from plenty of `:active` states sprinkled around.
Especially with a subtle 30 - 120 millisecond transition.
