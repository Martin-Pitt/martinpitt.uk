Someone asked about particle systems in a slack community
about particles that react to mouse movement.

Pondering about it made me remember what was crucial
in my early understanding for particle systems,
which just helped tie it all together nicely.

You can look up tutorials on the flocking algorithm, I’ve used a lot of
different sources from google to help me get a grasp for it.
The freedom to just “make shit up” when it comes to those ‘simple rules’
is empowering and creative.
