Code Clarity
	Writing code
	Can relate to Reading Clarity
	Shatter bad opinions you never realised you had
	My method:
		Write many web apps
		Trivial to major variations in typical coding standards & architecture
			Trivial to none if you do need to work with others
			Major variations are possible if a single-dev project (Disclaimer: Most of my work projects have only needed a single developer throughout its' lifetime; Able to be picked up later for amends or changes by another developer)
		Have an open mind
		MUST stay consistent within projects
		2-3 years later, work with your web apps again
		Try to attempt changes and see how it feels
		Take notes of things that do and don't work or could be improved
	My take aways from writing code in web apps
		How much code you can see in one screen makes all the difference to every rule in a coding standard
		Short vs. long variable names
		Spaces vs. tabs, lessions in accessibility
		To bracket on an empty line or not? - Vertical readability
		Compact single-line expressions?
		ternary? if : else
