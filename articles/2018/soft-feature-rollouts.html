Do you want to consider soft launching the feature?

I’m a fan of Google’s approach, where they transition a % of users gradually over time.
It's interesting because you can and track usage, metrics, errors and feedback as it rolls out.

It’s a different way of messaging, especially as users talk to eachother.

Before you rollout you can offer an opt-in toggle. While you rollout you can also offer an opt-out.
Remember that both transitions can be tracked via metrics.

Can tell you a lot about how something is being received - excitingly it can also tell you who the pioneers of your audience is, so you can prioritise them for further transitions as well.
