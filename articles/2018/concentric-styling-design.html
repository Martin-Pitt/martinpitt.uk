Concentric Styling Design

This is not new by the way, Brandon Rhodes put the idea into motion back in 2011
by publishing an article on this called [Concentric CSS](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2011/concentric-css/).

Years later, I think we have it pretty good with [the new CSS layout](https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout)
that allows us to make our boxes all squashy and flexible (CSS Flexible Box Layout) and finally reaching the holy grail
of two-dimensional layout (CSS Grid Layout).

However, there are always new and old people who may be unfamiliar with this approach to grouping CSS properties.

Let's break down the properties into 6 logical groups, from an outside-in approach of the CSS Box Model:
* Where the box is placed
* Box model behaviour - and how contents are affected
* Box model shape
* How it looks - the decor
* Typography
* State/Functional

If we map properties across these, we get this:
