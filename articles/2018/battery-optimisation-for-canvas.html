Canvas & WebGL Optimisation
	I would really like to promote battery efficiency in Canvas & WebGL experiences
	With the Battery API and a smarter, on-demand design of rendering we can make dramatic savings in performance & battery
	Fast, Good & Cheap tradeoffs of CPU, GPU & Memory





Canvas & WebGL Optimisation
Article/list on best practices to optimise Canvas & WebGL for battery efficiency.
Typical adage of precomputation. Spend computing stuff ahead of time, trading away
memory, and you’ll save lot of time in the future. @substack mentioned they use an
`.idle` property on effects, so that rendering parts know if it needs to rAF more
frames or if it can sit there – Definitely a clever way to do this, I think I often
seen this implemented as a `.isDirty` property in the past, an inversion here I feel
is  @mhazani says that one big optimization factor is realtime lighting, best avoided
if possible and that baked lighting can go a long way in many cases – I agree, have
seen baked stuff often look pretty phenomenal, especially with my own personal
experience of that in Second Life, hah, it was a classic way to get more bang per
buck for a lot of content creators.
