Bashing JavaScript

Like many web developers, I grew up becoming familiar with the commandline as a daily chore.

It is a fascinating world of little programs that take text, process it or do something because of it, finally returning text themselves.
This is especially empowering and incredible when these little programs are connected to eachother into a pipeline of machinery.

Eventually this kind of meta programming leads to learning a scripting language called BASH.

However, just as the world of web development changed, and the idea of universal JavaScript became a thing.
I realised that it was slow having to translate thoughts & ideas into a language I rarely use and find confusing (BASH).


I could picture the JavaScript code to do the same thing so easily, so why not?

Turns out you can.


If you have Node installed, then it is surprisingly to easy execute JS files as scripts; Append this line at the top:
```
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

Then you only need to make the file  executable as you would normally with bash scripts:
```
chmod u+x myscript.js
```

Then you can run it directly:
```
./myscript.js arg1 arg2 ...
```


With new ECMAScript in V8, you can do asynchronous operations. [Node.js finally has an async-friendly filesystem API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_promises_api).
When piping around data, JSON across programs is awesome.



Of course, this is not for everyone. But for web developers in particular, this is great.

BASH can be difficult to maintain and easy to screw up. A JavaScript file is easy to pick up even for newcomers to the team and junior members.
