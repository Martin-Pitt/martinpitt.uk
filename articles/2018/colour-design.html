Colour palettes aren’t the problem, it’s the design approach

I think using a good colour space system has been the most important for me in choosing colours
[1:16]
Ada has managed to capture my experiences and feelings on colours for web dev in her article: https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/human-friendly-colours-using-hsl-4944bcdb6e27 (edited)

It’s more than just what colours to use, but the path we take to get there. I’d been using rgb and hex colours for such a long time. Switching over to HSL was a bit of… a learning process and having to change habits. But now I never look back, it is without a question the better system to use.
[1:19]
hex/rgb are artifacts of legacy. I’d also love to use Lab colour space due to its’ superb output for grayscale imagery (take an image of a fire and then make it grayscale in Lab and your mind will be blown!), but implementing Lab is a science in itself that is beyond me. (edited)

Another thing I learned recently about colours is that, in a way, gradients can also be used as a colour. The shifting blend between two similar colours in a dithered gradient I feel can make up the feelings of seeing two colours as one in a way in our minds.

If you struggle to choose colours, a good trick is to design in grayscale first, because then you can concentrate on what’s important and then later you can really see where you can splash colour to improve it. (Esp. with HSLA where you can simply shift up saturation while keeping the same lightness and play with the hue :))

How does this article affect this one? It's very much related
